- [ ] If you login on the SVP, as the maintenance user, you should see the WebConsole for Device Manager aka Storage Navigator.
- [ ] There is a Maintenance Menu Option, 2nd option at the top left. Click on that and then launch Maintenance Components (General). That will bring up the  Java App for the SVP. You might have to check in Internet Explorer, if it doesn't launch automatically.
- [ ] By default you will be in "**View Mode**", so just click on that button, to change it to modify mode.
- [ ] Once in "**Modify Mode**", you can click on "**Information**", the select "**Log**", then select "SIM and click on the "List" button.\
- [ ] From here you can select and mark all SIMS as **completed**.
- [ ] Once you're done, remember to take the SVP out of Modify Mode, back to View Mode, otherwise the array will remain locked for maintenance.\
