<h1>network-protocol-performance-monitor-report</h1>
<p>Report all statistics stored by the network protocol performance monitor.</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>network-protocol-performance-monitor-report [--file-system &lt;file system&gt;] [-a] [-n]
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This command will, for each file system with monitoring enabled, display any file system performance statistics which have been gathered.  The statistics are intended for resolving performance problems.</p>
<p>Statistics are stored in memory, with each file system having a rolling buffer of statistics storing new samples and discarding old ones.</p>
<p>Options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-a, --all</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Report for both filesystems and non filesystem information.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>-n, --nonfs</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Report any non filesystem information.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>-f, --file-system &lt;filesystem&gt;</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Only report for the named filesystem. If omitted, all filesystems are reported.</p></dd>
</dl>
<h2>Report Format</h2>
<p>The report output is intended to be easy to parse into a form that can be analysed or fed into graphing software. The output is in sections with each section beginning and ending with a section heading marked with brackets '[]'. The contents of the brackets are a key word to describe which sort of section it is, optionally with an equals sign followed by value after it to give more information about the section such as the label of a file system.</p>
<p>The report is broken into sections with section headings as follows.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>[time="2012-11-15 10:19:24.000+00:00"]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Gives the timestamp of the most recent sample received. No data is expected after this header.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>[period="10.01905"]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Gives the measured sampling period of the samples. Ideally this is supposed to be 10 seconds exactly, but the data is generated by a part of the system with a different clock to the main clock. Usually this difference in clocks doesn't matter, but here where we can look back for days it is worth adjusting for this difference.</p></dd>
<dd><p>For a while after boot the server will not have enough samples to make an accurate estimate of the period, so it will report exactly 10.00000. By the time there are enough per filesystem samples for the difference to matter, an accurate period should be available.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>[headers]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The header is followed by a single line of data which gives a comma separated list of labels. These labels describe the columns of data given in the following file system sections, in the same order as they appear in the lines in that section.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>[fs="file-system-name"]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Each line in this section is a sample taken from the named file system. The first line is the most recent sample, the last line the oldest.  Each line is comma separated list of values, corresponding to the data given in the headers section before it.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>[values]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Each line in this section is a time sample taken from the non filesystem information. The first line is the most recent sample, the last line the oldest.  Each line is comma separated list of values, corresponding to the data given in the headers section before it.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>[end]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Marks the end of the report section, mainly to show that the file has not been truncated.</p></dd>
</dl>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Show current statistics logs for all file systems:</p>
<pre>    network-protocol-performance-monitor-report
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Example of an report from a server actively serving NFS traffic from file system Span0FS, but Span1FS is idle. To keep the report short, logging has only been on for one minute.</p>
