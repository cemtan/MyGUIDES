<h1>sd-fp-pending</h1>
<p>Dump failed or timed-out fast-path management I/Os that haven&#39;t yet completed</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>sd-fp-pending 
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>If an I/O error or timeout occurs while the server is reading or writing encroachment data or Cod signatures, it does not wait the (potentially very long) time required for the I/O to time out or complete: instead, it aborts the operation and lets all pending I/Os time out asynchronously.  'sd-fp-pending' lists all I/Os that are still waiting to time out.</p>
<p>The I/Os in question arise mainly from automatic actions that occur (for instance) when you create or expand a span or mount a file system, or which run regularly in the background.  Commands such as 'sd-dump-encroachment-area' use a different I/O path and can't cause this command to display any output.</p>
<p>If 'sd-fp-pending' reports that a span has outstanding failed I/Os, there are several consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The span can't be deleted ('span-delete')</li>
<li>The span can't be unlicensed ('span-deny-access' with no switches)</li>
<li>The server can't load an integrated Cod backup that would replace the span in memory</li>
<li>The server can't read or write encroachment data to the span or check any of its SDs' Cod signatures</li>
</ul>
<p>Other operations, including file service on the affected span, can continue normally.</p>
<p>The condition will clear, without user intervention, after a few seconds or minutes.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<pre>server:$ sd-fp-pending
HDP pre-allocation write to SD 11 (used in span Accounts)  at offset 81622204416 (0x1301100000)
server:$
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The pieces of information listed on each line include</p>
<ul>
<li>The I/O type</li>
<li>The system drive number</li>
<li>The span instance name and ID</li>
<li>The offset of the I/O and the structure that resides there</li>
</ul>
<p>The I/Os are listed in chronological order: the first I/Os in the list are most likely to complete first.</p>
