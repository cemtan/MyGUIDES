<h1>thread-list</h1>
<p>Lists current threads</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>thread-list [-a] [-d] [-e] [-i] [-m] [-r] [-s] [-l]
Alias:       ps
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The thread-list command, also known as ps, displays a list of extant threads on the current board.  It has many options for controlling which threads are listed and how the output is formatted.</p>
<p>With no options, thread-list produces a list of all threads, on the current board, which have not terminated.  The list has nine columns:</p>
<p>The "Id" is used to specify the thread to various console commands, most of whose names start with "thread-".</p>
<p>The "Name" is a human readable description of the main (or at least current) purpose of the thread.  There may be several threads with the same name.  This is perfectly desirable if they share a common purpose, particularly if they are part of a pool of threads used for carrying out the same tasks.</p>
<p>The "State" gives a concise indication of roughly what the thread is currently doing.  The utility is that it quickly lets you home in on the most interesting threads, although sometimes it can be useful to search for threads with a particular state.  The first part of the state field is made up by a subset of single characters from the set listed by thread-list -l (ell for "list").  This is sometimes followed by extra information in parentheses, such as the name of the file system which is being accessed by the thread.</p>
<p>The "State" field is often short but can be quite long.  In the thread-list output, long State entries are truncated and terminated with a +, to indicate truncation.  An unabbreviated version of this field is displayed, among other places, by the thread-stack-trace command.</p>
<p>The "Mill %" tells you how much processing power has been consumed by this thread since thread-list -r or reboot.  If the thread has used a non-zero amount of time but less than 0.01%, its usage will be displayed as "~0.00".  This is useful when a thread is making progress but very slowly, as the reason for progress being slow is unlikely to be the same as the reason why progress has halted.</p>
<p>The three stack-related columns show the current amount of free space on the thread's stack, the "low water mark" of that figure and the application-visible size of the stack.  The "-LWM" shows the nearest this thread has been to running out of stack - the lower the number, the closer we are to danger.  There is a large safety margin below the applicable-visible end of the stack, with the result that it's possible for "-LWM" to go negative with no ill effect.  This is intended to be scary enough to cause a bug to be raised.  The "-Free" figure is occasionally useful when trying to determine which threads from a pool are blocked in the same place and so which one is doing something different.  That one is inevitably more interesting.  "-Free" and "-LWM" will both be zero if the thread has not had its stack allocated yet.  This happens if a thread has never been run, which implies that it's in the "C" state.  Two classes of threads have non-default stack sizes, both for probably obsolete reasons, and if it weren't for those, we could lose the last, "-Size", column.  "-Free" and "-LWM" are both in bytes whereas "-Size", which is always a round number, is in KB for the sake of clarity and to allow us to display more columns on screen.</p>
<p>The scheduler has three primitives, Wake, Block and Yield.  The last two columns, "Blocks" and "Yields", count the number of these calls that each thread has made.  When a thread calls Block, it isn't scheduled until another thread calls Wake on it.  When a thread calls Yield, it goes to the back of the ready queue.</p>
<p>thread-list -a (for "active") lists the "active" threads.  This is the most useful option, to the point that a case could be made for making it the default.  The scheduler has a notion of a thread being "active" when it has some work to do.  This is a higher level notion than that of being ready to run.  A thread may be waiting for input or a response, ie not ready to run, while still being active.  Only when the application controlling the thread has no work to do on that thread should the thread be marked as idle.</p>
<p>thread-list -d (for "debugging") lists just crashed threads.  This is only useful within Engineering, via the serial console.</p>
<p>thread-list -e (for "every") includes threads which have terminated (but whose memory hasn't been deallocated).</p>
<p>thread-list -i (for "idle") displays just the last line of the output, giving the time attributable to "Total unsuccessful polls".  In the main body of the thread-list listing, some threads have an additional line attributing time to "unsuccessful polls".  This is the closest the software gets to being idle - polling the VLSI and finding nothing to do.</p>
<p>thread-list -l (for "list") decodes the meanings of the individual letters which go to make up the first part of the State field.  Some of these letters, which are case sensitive, are board-type specific, although there are a core set which are the same on each board.</p>
<p>thread-list -m (for "memory") displays the range of accessible stack addresses for each thread.  The table is sorted by stack address and appears in this format:</p>
<pre>server$ thread-list -m
Id  Name                    Accessible stack addresses
==  ====                    ==========================
1   idle thread             [0x10f25000, 0x10f44000)
...
197 cache: flush            [0x2379e000, 0x237bd000)
server$
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>thread-list -r (for "reset"), as previously mentioned, resets all the time statistics and the block and yield counts to zero.  The stack "-LWM" statistic is calculated by searching for the first four bytes in the stack which don't contain the "\x73\x74\x63\x6b" fill pattern ("stck" in ASCII), so this isn't reset by thread-list -r.</p>
<p>thread-list -s (for "summarize") summarizes statistics for threads with the same name.  The Id and State columns are misleading when multiple threads' statistics have been summarized so, in that situation, they are given the value "-".  The Mill %, Blocks and Yields columns are totalled for all threads with the same name.  The displayed value for each of the Stack "columns" is the minimum value across all threads with the same name.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Don't rely on these lists of the state values supported by thread-list -l - no-one will keep them up-to-date:</p>
<pre>server(NIM):$ thread-list -l
The state field can have the following values:
  C ... created but not run
  D ... in debugger
  F ... frozen
  I ... idle/boring
  J ... owns global vnodes lock
  R ... ready to run
  T ... preempted by timer
  W ... waiting
  X ... exited (but not deleted) (only shown with thread-list -e)
  Z ... owns rf cache lock
  j ... waiting for global vnodes lock
  r ... would be ready to run if we were not debugging
  z ... waiting for rf cache lock
server(NIM):$
server(FSA):$ thread-list -l
The state field can have the following values:
  A ... waiting for checkpoint atomicity write lock

server(FSA):$
server(SIM):$ thread-list -l
The state field can have the following values:
  C ... created but not run
  D ... in debugger
  F ... frozen
  I ... idle/boring
  R ... ready to run
  T ... preempted by timer
  W ... waiting
  X ... exited (but not deleted) (only shown with thread-list -e)
  Z ... owns rf cache lock

<p>Don't look for the state meaning "running".  The thread you are interested in is never running.  The only thread running is the one executing the "thread-list" command.  We didn't used to even have a state for the running thread (it now appears as "@").  There is no thread State which in and of itself is bad, except "D", which cannot be observed except in Engineering configurations.</p>
<p>"IW" is the commonest value, meaning idle and waiting.  "R" meaning "ready" is common on a busy system.  "r" is sometimes seen against many threads in Engineering.  This means that the thread would be ready except that it's not being run because we are debugging another thread.</p>

<p>As you can see, thread-list takes a long time.  Indeed, it is O(n*n) in the number of threads.  This is due to wanting to pay the minimum price in performance-critical code for marking a thread as entering or leaving one of the "State" letters.  This needs to change because it makes the diagnostics take longer than the 10s window available to them.</p>
