<h1>cluster-interfaces</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The Intra-Cluster Connect (ICC) interfaces are used for communications between members of a cluster.</p>
<p>These interfaces exchange network traffic between the cluster members for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>internal management messages,</li>
<li>NVRAM mirroring for write I/O data, this involves synchronous replication of the write I/O data to ensure that copies of the same data are available on multiple nodes to maintain data consistency following a node failure,</li>
<li>Cluster Name Space (CNS) communications, this consists of re-directed I/O requests resulting from an I/O request for a CNS resource which is located on another cluster member.</li>
</ul>
<p>The management network interfaces are also used for cluster inter-node management communications.</p>
<p>The ICC interfaces are named cN. The c1 interface uses an internally assigned IP address for inter-node management communications which can not be administratively configured.</p>
<p>The ICC interfaces are not available for any other purposes such as management access or file-serving access. ICC was previously also known as HSSI.</p>
<p>For additional information on configuring the cluster interconnect network refer to the System Installation Guide.</p>
<h2>Intra-cluster network guidelines</h2>
<p>All cN interfaces must be used to achieve full system performance and to ensure resilient operation following network equipment failures.</p>
<p>Each cN interface must be reachable from the equivalent numbered interfaces on the other nodes in the cluster.</p>
<p>For a two-node cluster, the cN interfaces can be directly connected; for clusters with more than two nodes, network switches must be used.</p>
<p>Any intervening network must be configured as an Ethernet Layer-2 network which is isolated from other network traffic. In particular traffic for different clusters should be isolated from each other. The network should be designed to allow active redundant operation of all of the cN interfaces.</p>
<p>Any intervening Ethernet switches must be configured to allow use of Jumbo frames with an Ethernet frame size of at-least 9216 octets; this is required regardless of the configured IP MTU for the cN interfaces as the NVRAM mirroring traffic generated by the VLSI always uses Jumbo frames. The Ethernet switches must also be configured to obey the Ethernet frame tag priorities, i.e. the IEEE 802.1p Priority Code Point (PCP).</p>
<p>If a VLAN is used to isolate the cluster interconnect network(s) the corresponding access switch ports should be configured to be untagged members of the VLAN as the cN ports are not VLAN aware.</p>
