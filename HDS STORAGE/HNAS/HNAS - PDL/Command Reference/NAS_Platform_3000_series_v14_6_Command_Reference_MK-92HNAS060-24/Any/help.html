<h1>help</h1>
<p>Show command help</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>help [-k] all|&lt;command&gt;
Alias:       ?
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Shows brief command help</p>
<p>Options</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-k</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Chain to apropos if no exact match</p></dd>
<dt><strong>all</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Show brief description of all commands</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>As well as a brief description and an informal syntax, the help includes a number of other fields:</p>
<p>A user level of "User" indicates that the command may display confidential information about the cluster's configuration. A user level of "Supervisor" indicates that the command can alter configuration. A user level of "Dev" indicates a command designed for use under guidance from Engineering. Commands which can be executed even without being logged in, such as "help", have a user level of "Any". Only the command's minimum level is given by its "help". Some commands have several sub-commands, which may enforce further restrictions. "user list", for example, is available at "user" level, while "user add" requires "supervisor" privilege.</p>
<p>The "needs" field serves a number of purposes, including automatic forwarding of the command to an appropriate cluster node. If a command requires the "Admin Service", then it will be forwarded to the cluster node hosting that service for execution. If a command is deemed "Local to EVS", then it will be forwarded to the cluster node hosting the EVS in context. The EVS in context can be changed with the "console-context" command or its relatives. The "needs" field is part of the implementation of the behavior documented by the "applies to" section of the corresponding man page.</p>
<p>On a multi-board platform, the "Native to" field identifies which board types host the command. When a single board type provides the command, an invocation of the command will be automatically forwarded to the appropriate board for execution. When more than one board type provides the command, consider using the "nim", "fsm" or "sim" commands to explicitly specify which board type should be used. This is compulsory when the board type in context doesn't provide the command but the other two board types do.</p>
<p>Some commands have aliases, which are usually abbreviations for the command name.</p>
