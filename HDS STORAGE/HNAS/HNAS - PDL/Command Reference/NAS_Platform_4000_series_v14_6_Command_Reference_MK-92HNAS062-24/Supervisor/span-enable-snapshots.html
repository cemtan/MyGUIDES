<h1>span-enable-snapshots</h1>
<p>Put a span into copy-on-write snapshot mode</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>span-enable-snapshots &lt;span-label&gt; &lt;new-snapshot-name&gt;
Alias:       snapon
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Puts a span into snapshot mode, so that it can be used with storage-based snapshots, as provided by the Hitachi Thin Image (HTI) and Copy-On-Write (CoW) Snapshot features.  See 'storage-based-snapshot' and 'storage-based-snapshot-label' for background information.</p>
<p>This command does not create or detect a new copy of the span.  It does, however, prepare the span for use with further snapshots.  It also assigns a new snapshot name to the existing copy of the span and, in doing so, changes the instance names of the span and all its filesystems.</p>
<p>In order to use storage-based snapshots, it is also necessary to configure the storage and to install the necessary license.  Both these operations must carried out in a storage configurator such as Storage Navigator or Hitachi Command Suite.</p>
<p>There is no need to unmount file systems before running 'span-enable-snapshots'.</p>
<p>A span cannot be placed into snapshot mode if it has storage-based mirror relationships or has been assigned to more than one cluster.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Suppose span Departments contains filesystem Engineering.  The administrator wishes to use snapshots with this span.  Snapshot name 'Master' is chosen, because the original span contains the master copy of the data.</p>
<pre>span-enable-snapshots Departments Master
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>After this operation, the span will have been renamed as 'Departments-Master' and the filesystem as 'Engineering-Master'.  Therefore, to mount and unmount the file system, it will be necessary to type</p>
<pre>mount Engineering-Master
unmount Engineering-Master
</pre>
<p></p>
