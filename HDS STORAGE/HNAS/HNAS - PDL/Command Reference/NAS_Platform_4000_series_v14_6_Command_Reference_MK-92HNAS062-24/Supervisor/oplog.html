<h1>oplog</h1>
<p>Displays summary information of the last few inquiries &amp; responses.</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>oplog [-d] [-vol N] [-long] [-inq N]
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Dumps the VLSI "operation log", or "oplog".</p>
<p>The first line of output, which looks something like "All valid=1, wr_addr=39, start_addr=39, stop_addr=38" is not generally useful. After that comes a table, with one row per operation. The actual number of operations recorded depends on your exact hardware (and is shown at boot time). You may see fewer rows if insufficient operations have been processed since boot, but this is highly unlikely in practice.</p>
<p>Each row has a number of columns.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>InqN</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is the VLSI's internal inquiry number. It can be used to correlate with other diagnostic information.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>Vol</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is the VLSI's internal volume number corresponding to the file system the operation applied to. It is usually 1024 less than the volume number shown by the "df" command. It can be used to discriminate concurrent operations on different file systems.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>AI</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows whether an inquiry was the result of auto-inquiry; that is, was processed without any software involvement. If the AI column shows 'RM' then this indicates an inquiry that was generated by a remote node and forwarded to this node.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>AR</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows whether a response was auto-responded; that is, was sent on the network via the VLSI's own fast path. If the AR column shows 'RM' then this indicates that the response was a response to an inquiry that was generated by a remote node (and hence the response was sent back to the remote node).</p></dd>
<dt><strong>BO</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows whether an inquiry was bounced from VLSI to software instead of being auto-inquired.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>NV</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows whether the operation was logged in NVRAM.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>CCp</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows the number of compressed checkpoints. If this number is non-zero, then that number of additional checkpoints on the same volume (with no other intervening inquiries) have been elided from the log. This behavior can be enabled/disabled with the "oplog-ctrl" command, and is disabled by default, so under normal use this field should always be 0.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>Ch</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows the number of "chunks" logged to NVRAM.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>Command</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows the specific kind of operation.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>Status</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows either the overall result of the operation (WFS_SUCCESS or a specific error code starting ERR_), or RspNotReceived, meaning the operation is still being processed.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>RspTime</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Shows, for operations that have completed, the number of microseconds required to process the operation.</p></dd>
</dl>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>To see the WFILE_WRITE operations currently in the oplog:</p>
<pre>oplog | grep WFILE_WRITE
</pre>
