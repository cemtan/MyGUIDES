<h1>span-disable-snapshots</h1>
<p>Take a span out of copy-on-write snapshot mode</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>span-disable-snapshots &lt;span-base-or-instance-name&gt;
Alias:       snapoff
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Storage-based products such as the Hitachi Thin Image (HTI) and Copy-On-Write (CoW) Snapshot features enable you to take multiple read--write snapshots of a span.  Support for these products is described in the 'storage-based-snapshot' and 'storage-based-snapshot-label' man pages.</p>
<p>Before a span can be used with storage-based snapshots, you must place it into snapshot mode by running 'span-enable-snapshots'.  In this mode, some operations are impossible and the behavior of others is changed, and the names of the span and its filesystems are modified.</p>
<p>You can take a span out of snapshot mode by running 'span-disable-snapshots'.  The span can no longer be used with storage-based snapshots, but operations that were impossible in snapshot mode become possible again.</p>
<p>When this command is run, the span must be in snapshot mode, but it must not have any snapshots.  File systems may be either mounted or unmounted.</p>
<p>This command removes the span's snapshot name.  In doing so, it changes the instances names of the span and all its filesystems.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Suppose a span with base name 'Departments' is in snapshot mode; its snap name is 'Master'.  Its instance name is 'Departments-Master', and the instance names of its filesystems are 'Accounts-Master', 'Engineering-Master' and 'Sales-Master'.</p>
<p>To disable snapshot mode, use either of the following commands:</p>
<pre>span-disable-snapshots Departments-Master
</pre>
<p></p>
<pre>span-disable-snapshots Departments
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>This operation renames the span as 'Departments' and its filesystems as 'Accounts', 'Engineering' and 'Sales'.</p>
<p>You can now perform operations such as expanding the span:</p>
<pre>span-expand Departments 60-79
</pre>
