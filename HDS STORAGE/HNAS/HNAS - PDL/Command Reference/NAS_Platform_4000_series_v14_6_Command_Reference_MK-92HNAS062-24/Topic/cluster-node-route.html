<h1>cluster-node-route</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>In the standard routing mode, the static routing configuration is cluster-wide. This implies that all traffic from all cluster nodes destined for a specific off-subnet address may be channelled via the same gateway. With cluster-node-routing enabled, static routes can configured separately and differently, for each cluster node. This allows off-subnet cluster traffic to be spread over multiple gateways.</p>
<p>It is not possible to use both cluster-node and standard routes simultaneously. The routing table will contain routes of only either type at any given time. It is, however, possible to configure cluster-node-routes when operating in standard routing mode, and vice-versa. Switching between modes reloads the routing configuration. This will cause the routing, ARP and NDP caches to be flushed.</p>
<p>Dynamic routes created in response to ICMP Router Discovery or RIP messages are typically seen by all heads in a cluster. Such dynamic routes may well act so as to undo the effects of cluster-node-routes, and therefore it is advisable to disable RIP and IRDP.</p>
