<p>Manage members of local groups</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>localgroup &lt;operation&gt;
where &lt;operation&gt; is one of:
group-names
list [&lt;group&gt;]
export [&lt;group&gt;]
add &lt;group&gt; &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;user&gt;...
del &lt;group&gt; &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;user&gt;...
delall --confirm
set &lt;group&gt; &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;user&gt;...
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><strong>localgroup group-names</strong></dt>
<dd><p>List configured and special group names</p></dd>
<dt><strong>localgroup list [&lt;group&gt;]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>List the members of a local group (default: all groups)</p></dd>
<dt><strong>localgroup export [&lt;group&gt;]</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Export group definitions as commands</p></dd>
<dt><strong>localgroup add &lt;group&gt; &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;user&gt;...</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Add members to a local group</p></dd>
<dt><strong>localgroup del &lt;group&gt; &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;user&gt;...</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Delete members from a local group</p></dd>
<dt><strong>localgroup delall --confirm</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Delete all local groups</p></dd>
<dt><strong>localgroup set &lt;group&gt; &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;user&gt;...</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Sets a group's entire membership</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Current special groups are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrators</li>
<li>Backup Operators</li>
<li>Forced Groups</li>
<li>Root Users</li>
<li>Audit Service Accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Membership of the Administrators group confers the right to take ownership of any file and allows access to audit settings (SACLs).</p>
<p>Membership of the Backup Operators group causes file permissions checking to be bypassed for the user.  This is not quite the same as Root Users, which also grants a bypass for sharing violations and allows access to audit settings (SACLs). Root Users is intended to grant equivalent power to Unix root.</p>
<p>If a user is a member of a group G and G is a member of the Forced Groups group, then the user's primary group will be changed to G. The primary group is the default group for files created by that user.</p>
<p>Consider the case where each Windows user's primary group is "Domain Users" but many of those users are in one or other of the groups "software" or "testing". In Unix, it would be usual for "software" or "testing" to be a user's primary group. A file's group doesn't play an active role in the Windows security model but it is a widely used part of the Unix model, where each file has three permission bits granting rights to members of the file's group. When a Windows user creates a file, it can be useful for members of the same Unix primary group to have more access to the file than other users. So it's helpful for Unix and not harmful to Windows, in a multi-protocol environment, for a Windows user to have the same primary group as the corresponding Unix user. An ideal solution, then, is to change the primary group in the Active Directory but organizational policies sometimes render that impossible or inconvenient.</p>
<p>The primary-group- commands provide an alternative mechanism for achieving a similar goal. The Forced Groups mechanism can be less work to administer because only one piece of administration (localgroup add) needs to be done for each new group instead of one piece of administration (primary-group-set) per new user. At the expense of some additional complexity, though, the primary-group-set commands can be derived from NIS and applied automatically on a regular basis for a zero-administration solution. Consult your support provider if that solution best fits your needs.</p>
<p>The primary-group- overriding mechanism has a finer granularity and is applied after "Forced Groups" so that it can be used to handle exceptional cases.</p>
<p>Audit Service Accounts is a user group which prevents audit logs being generated for members of the group. This allows maintenance activities carried out by these users, that might otherwise generate excessive audit log entries, from swamping more relevant log entries.</p>
<p>Both users and groups can be members of local groups.  Membership of a group which is a member of a local group confers membership of the local group.  So, formally speaking, group membership is transitive.</p>
<p>If given no member arguments, "localgroup del" deletes any local group configuration relating to the group.</p>
<p>The localgroup command doesn't allow new accounts to be created, it just allows the membership relationship between existing users and groups to be augmented.  Under the hood, both the users and groups are handled as numeric SIDs.</p>
<p>Unix users and groups can be added to local groups using numeric names as demonstrated in EXAMPLES (or by using the Windows users and groups they map to).  By using the numeric notation for the Unix group, then, you can grant membership of any Unix group to a Windows user. This can be particularly useful in situations where Windows users need to access directory trees that are primarily Unix-secured.</p>
<p>Saving of local group updates is automatic by default but delayed by a few seconds in case another update arrives. local-group-save does not return until persistence is ensured. Before release 5.0, extant credentials were synchronously reassessed when saving took place. This now happens in the background (and even if local-group-disable-saving is in effect). Where it is important to ensure that changes have been activated, the credentials-reassess command is now required. connection -v all and credentials-list can be used to inspect the extant credentials. Newly created credentials always use the latest copy of the local group table.</p>
<p>In release 5.0, both CIFS credentials and NFS credentials are affected. In earlier releases, behavior varied according to the security on the file being accessed.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<pre>$ localgroup add "Backup Operators" "DOMAIN\User"
$ localgroup list "Backup Operators"
Backup Operators:
  DOMAIN\User (S-1-5-21-2890616873-267894613-134697825-1678)
</pre>
<p></p>
<pre>$ localgroup add "Backup Operators" "Unix user\521"
$ localgroup list "Backup Operators"
Backup Operators:
  DOMAIN\User (S-1-5-21-2890616873-267894613-134697825-1678)
  Unix user\521 (S-1-77-0-521)
</pre>
<p></p>
<pre>$ localgroup add "Forced Groups" "Unix group\100"
$ localgroup list "Forced Groups"
Forced Groups:
  Unix group\100 (S-1-77-1-100)
</pre>
<p></p>
<pre>$ vn -q all localgroup export
vn 1 localgroup set S-1-1-0 S-1-1-0
