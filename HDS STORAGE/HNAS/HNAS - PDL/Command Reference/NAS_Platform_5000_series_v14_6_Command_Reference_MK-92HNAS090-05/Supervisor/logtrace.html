<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>logtrace [all | none]
logtrace [on | off] {&lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt;...}
logtrace resize &lt;size-in-K&gt; &lt;name&gt; {&lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt;...}
logtrace [tson | tsoff] &lt;name&gt; {&lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt;...}
logtrace dump &lt;name&gt; {&lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt;...}
logtrace clear &lt;name&gt; {&lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt;...}
Alias:       lt
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>A logtrace is a temporary store of diagnostic information that is normally not kept, but which can be displayed at the console during troubleshooting.</p>
<p>A logtrace can be enabled or disabled: enabling it means that information will appear on the console and in the dblog (but not in ssc or ssh) as soon as it is produced.  By default, some logtraces are enabled and others not.  Manipulating a logtrace on one node has no effect on the same logtrace on other cluster nodes.</p>
<p>In addition, logtracing can be globally enabled or disabled; disabling it means that output that would normally be printed at the console and in the dblog is suppressed.  This output can still be displayed manually, however, as long as it has not rotated out of the logtrace.  Once again, enabling or disabling logtracing on one cluster node has no effect on other nodes.</p>
<p>Each logtrace has a name, which you can use to manipulate it at the command line.  It is also a member of a group, which has a name of its own.  You can use group names to manipulate several logtraces at once.</p>
<p>The 'logtrace' command has several subcommands.  Their exact syntax is shown below.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>logtrace</p>
<p>Prints a list of all available logtraces on the server where the command is run.  A line of output like this --</p>
<pre>   span:tr, len 11.1 KB, cap 64 KB, TS
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>-- means that the logtrace 'tr' is in group 'span'; it currently contains 11.1KiB of text; it can hold 64KiB before the oldest information is lost; and timestamps are enabled for this logtrace.</p>
<p>logtrace dump tr mgspan</p>
<p>Displays the contents of the 'tr' and 'mgspan' logtraces.</p>
<p>logtrace clear tr</p>
<p>Erases all text in the 'tr' logtrace.</p>
<pre>logtrace tson macro
logtrace tsoff span
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Enables timestamping for the 'macro' logtrace; disables it for all logtraces in the 'span' group.</p>
<pre>logtrace all
logtrace none
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Enables or disables all logtraces on the server where the command is run.</p>
<p>logtrace off</p>
<p>Disables console and dblog output for all logtraces, even those that are enabled.</p>
<p>logtrace on</p>
<p>Reenables console and dblog output for all enabled logtraces.</p>
<p>logtrace resize 96 macro span</p>
<p>Resizes the 'macro' logtrace, and all logtraces in the 'span' group, to 96KiB.  This means that the logtraces can hold 96KiB of text, including timestamps if enabled, before the oldest text is discarded.  If the new size is smaller than the amount of text currently stored in the logtrace, the oldest text is discarded.  You must be logged in as dev to resize a logtrace.</p>
