<h1>span-list-snapshots</h1>
<p>List all the snapshots of a specified span</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>span-list-snapshots &lt;base-or-instance-name&gt;
Alias:       snaps
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Your storage supports read--write snapshots via its Hitachi Thin Image (HTI) or Copy-On-Write (CoW) Snapshot feature.  To understand the server's support for this feature, see the 'storage-based-snapshot' and 'storage-based-snapshot-label' man pages.</p>
<p>The server represents storage-based snapshots as individual spans.  It is often necessary to know which snapshots are versions of the same data.  The 'span-list-snapshots' command accepts the base name or instance name of any span that's in snapshot mode, and prints a list of all the snapshots that belong with it.</p>
<p>'span-list' shows each snapshot as a separate span and shows more detail than 'span-list-snapshots', but can't display snapshots that haven't been loaded from Cod.  'span-list-snapshots', in contrast, can display unloaded snapshots so that you can delete them retrospectively.  As soon as any one SD in a snapshot is healthy, primary and licensed, the server will load the snapshot from Cod and be able to display that one snapshot in 'span-list', but it will also load enough information to display all the other snapshots of the same span in 'span-list-snapshots'.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<pre>server:$ span-list-snapshots accounts
Unloaded   . . . .    Accounts-DataMine
. . . .    Original   Accounts-Main
. . . .    . . . .    Accounts-WhatIf
server:$
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The first column shows 'Unloaded' if the snapshot has not been loaded into memory (that is, if it wouldn't appear in the output of 'span-list').  In most circumstances, all snapshots will be loaded; one reason a snapshot might not be loaded is that an administrator has deleted the underlying snapshot system drives and then rebooted the cluster without telling the server to delete the snapshot.</p>
<p>The second column shows the word 'Original' if this is the original copy of the data -- the copy on which 'span-enable-snapshots' was run, rather than a copy that was added by 'span-add-snapshot'.  Only snapshots that don't show the word 'Original' can be deleted by 'span-delete-snapshot'.</p>
<p>The third column shows the instance name of the snapshot.  Snapshots are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
