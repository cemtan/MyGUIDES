<h1>cod-backup-list</h1>
<p>Show brief details of a file created by span-back-up-cod or sd-back-up-cod</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>cod-backup-list [-F | --ssfs] &lt;filename&gt;
Alias:       cod-back-up-list
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Shows a summary of a Cod backup file.  Cod backups are explained in the 'cod' man page.</p>
<p>For a single-SD Cod backup (an SDC), it shows the time when the file was created and the current device ID of the system drive from which the Cod was copied.  SDCs are produced by the 'sd-back-up-cod' command.</p>
<p>For an integrated Cod backup (an ICB), it shows the permanent ID, config ID and instance name of the span; the time when the backup was taken; the schema (format) number of the backup and of the span Cod; whether the span has one or two admin areas per system drive; the current (and, if different, historical) device IDs of the system drives used by the span; and the permanent IDs and base names of the file systems provided by the span.  ICBs are produced by the 'span-back-up-cod' command or saved automatically by the SMU.</p>
<p>(Admin ares are 1MiB regions of disk space reserved for Cod, encroachment data and similar srtuctures.)</p>
<p>Timestamps are displayed in the local timezone.</p>
<p>If you're using ssc, the backup file is read from the ssc file system (i.e. on the computer running the ssc client); you can choose to read it from the server's ssfs file system instead by providing the --ssfs or -F switch.  In all other environments the file is always read from the ssfs file system.</p>
<p>If the file is read from SSFS, it is, by default, read from the cluster node where the command is run.  To read it from another server's SSFS file system, use the syntax detailed in the 'ssfs' man page.</p>
