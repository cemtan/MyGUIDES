<h1>multi-tenancy-enable</h1>
<p>enable multi-tenant environment</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<pre>multi-tenancy-enable 
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Enables the multi-tenant environment.</p>
<p>It is likely that this command will only be run when first configuring a new system.  See the multi-tenancy manual page for further details.</p>
<p>Enabling the multi-tenant environment will cause a temporary loss of service to all EVSs while they are enabled for use.</p>
<p>It is important to note that all connections to the server will be disconnected during this enabling process. This includes the connection that may be being used to execute the enabling command.</p>
<p>Once converted, if an EVS was enabled and was ready to serve files, it will serve files as before, but be configurable as required for a multi-tenant environment.</p>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<p>Multi-tenancy can only be enabled if all cluster nodes are multi-tenant capable, and are all online. It also requires an "EVS Security" license.</p>
<p>Multi-tenancy cannot be enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>if any EVS is configured with global security settings. This can be resolved by setting the EVSs to individual security by use of the '<code>evs-security</code>' command and copying the required configuration.</li>
<li>if any deprecated VLAN subnet is still configured in the system. VLAN interfaces must be used instead. VLAN subnets can be removed with the '<code>vlan remove-all</code>' command.</li>
<li>if there is a cluster namespace configured, you will need to use the '<code>namespace-delete</code>' command prior to enabling.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Enabling the multi-tenant environment with EVSs configured with individual security.</p>
<pre>server:$ multi-tenancy-enable
