<h1>routing-by-evs</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>When enabled, routing-by-evs changes the way that the network stack's routing engine behaves.  Traditionally, the network stack has been at liberty to choose any of the source IP addresses that are currently deployed on a cluster node for initiating external communications.  Over a number of releases, some sub-systems have been changed such that they'll ensure that the routing engine uses only source IP addresses associated with the EVS that they're working on behalf of. With routing-by-evs enabled, this'll now apply to many sub-systems where such change in behavior could be undesirable as it may cause issues for existing installations.</p>
<p>One such sub-system is DNS. If routing-by-evs is enabled, then any name lookup via DNS will fail unless there's a way to get from one of the source IP addresses associated with the EVS in context to the DNS server(s).</p>
<p>Note that there are still some commands that behave in the traditional manner as they're used for diagnostic purposes on the cluster node in question. For example, ping, ping6, test-route, traceroute and traceroute6. Where applicable, they'll use the admin EVS for the name lookup but the routing engine is still at liberty to choose any source IP address currently active on the cluster node.</p>
<p>Note that if multi-tenancy is enabled, then the routing engine behaves as if routing-by-evs is enabled.</p>
