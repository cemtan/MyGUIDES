<h1>routing</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This page describes how the network stack's routing engine behaves when transmitting IP packets.</p>
<p>Here are the types of route the routing engine supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>host routes.  A host route defines a way to communicate with a specific host by sending the packet to a gateway.</li>
<li>net routes. A net route defines a way to communicate with a specific network by sending that packet to a gateway.</li>
<li>on-link prefixes. These are networks that are directly reachable on the link.</li>
<li>interface routes. An interface route is the combination of a local IP address and the prefix it's in.</li>
<li>default gateways. These are used for IP addresses that are otherwise unreachable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, the routing engine takes the destination and source address into consideration when working out a route. If the source address is known, then only routes whose gateway is in the same network as the source address are considered. If the source address is not known, then any routes are considered when making the routing decision. In the case that no source address is known, the routing engine will not consider addresses on an interface that is DOWN when choosing a source address. The routing decision is made using this algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the destination matches the target of a dynamic host route and the gateway is applicable for the source address, then use that route;</li>
<li>if the destination matches the target of a static host route and the gateway is applicable for the source address, then use that route;</li>
<li>if the destination matches the network of one of the interface routes and the source address is applicable, then send direct;</li>
<li>if the destination matches one of the on-link prefixes, then send direct;</li>
<li>if the destination matches the target of a static net route and the gateway is applicable for the source address, then use that route;</li>
<li>if the destination matches the target of a dynamic net route and the gateway is applicable for the source address, then use that route;</li>
<li>if there's a default gateway that matches the source address, then use that route;</li>
<li>if none of the above, then there's no route to the destination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the routing engine may not take into account the current EVS when choosing the source address, see the routing-by-evs man page for more details.</p>
